\section{Introduction}
% what is this project about and why is it interesting?

\section{Related Work}
% meaningfully summarize related literature to explain what this project builds
% on, in particular, discuss the two research papers chosen with this project
% (and discussed in your presentation)

\subsection{OpenSky Network}
Most of aircraft are provided with ADB-S transmitter, which send continuosly information about the status and the position of the aircraft to guarantee better air traffic control. The messages are not encripted end, in most region, this technology will become mandatory in 2020. For these reasons OpenSky network was recently born. \\
OpenSky is an open source network that aggregates ADS-B messages collected by volunteers around the globe. The dataset is accessible to everyone for non-profit purposes and the data is provided in the raw format, in order to perform research and statistics about air traffic. \\
However there are some limitation to the data. Only part of Europe has a good coverage, which means there are many areas where is not yet possible to detect airplanes informations. Furthermore messages are collected by volunteers and there is not guarantee that antennas are working properly 24/7.

    \subsubsection{ADS-B messages}

    The ADS-B standard defines different kinds of messages which are sent at different frequencies:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Aircraft identification} messages contain the callsign of the airplane;
        \item \textit{Airborne position} messages contain altitude, latititude and longitude of the airplane and are sent twice per second;
        \item \textit{Airborne velocity} messages contain climb rate and velocity of the airplane.
    \end{itemize}
    In addition to these messages, other emergencies, priority, capability, navigation accuracy category, and operational modes messages could be broadcasted.

\subsection{Route detection}
A way to reduce the number of air routes is illustrated in \textit{J. DeArmon et al, Air Route Clustering for a Queuing Network Model of the National Airspace System}. The research showed that similar routes can be grouped to reduce the number of path between a pair of airports thus decrease air traffic congestion. The same approach could be used to detect standard routes where aircraft fly, given the departure and arrival airports. The first prototype of this model has been developed to improve the air traffic flow in the National Airspace System of the USA.

    

\section{Research Questions}
% which questions is this project trying to answer, and/or hypotheses to
% investigate? These should cover both the project topic, as well as the
% technological side (aptness of the tools for the job, scalability of the
% solution).

\begin{itemize}
  \item What are the standard routes?
  \item Which flights and airlines diverge from them? In which airports?
  \item How much CO2 would be saved if aircrafts followed a straight-line route
  instead of the standard one?
\end{itemize}

Additionally

\begin{itemize}
  \item How to use raw ADS-B data to identify flights?
\end{itemize}

% questions? Insights in the usability of the employed technology for particular
% tasks?
